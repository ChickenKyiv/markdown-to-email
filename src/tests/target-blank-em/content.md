A crypto-winter later, just when we thought that:

*   Altcoin season was over
*   Decentralized Exchanges were dead in the water
*   Crypto won’t grow without regulators’ tacit approval,

Along came [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/whitepaper.pdf) and ended all doubts that crypto was a fad that had lived out its 15 seconds of fame.

The innocuous-sounding [DeFi](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/defi) or Decentralized Finance had humble beginnings in the days of the ICOs where ‘Banking the Unbanked’ was the de facto sales pitch of ICO Founders on LinkedIn and Twitter. 

Today, DeFi has metamorphosed into the befitting reply to centralized exchanges like [Binance](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/binance) and Coinbase. Exchanges like [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/protocol-over_vi_ew/how-uniswap-works) and the similarly named Mooniswap have dealt a death-blow to the Order Book, upon which, centralized exchanges, their listed tokens liquidity, and the alleged shady listing-fees market was _built_ .
