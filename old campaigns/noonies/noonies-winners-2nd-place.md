Hi <Name>,

YOU ARE the Buzz Aldrin of <Award Name> at Noonies 2020.

While Neil Armstrong might’ve been the first one to set foot on the moon, it was Buzz Aldrin that etched himself in our collective memory.

Why?

Well, in Aldrin’s case, he walked second because Armstrong outranked him.

At Noonies, there are no ranks to outrank you. However, the Internet is a strange place where cults are born and dissolved on a daily basis.

You might be the 1st Runner up this year. Maybe, next year, you get voted to the 1st place.

But that’s something to think about tomorrow.

Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert2">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>
